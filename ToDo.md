# Requirements

## Project Management
- [x] Use Github for organization of your workload. Devide your workload and manage it by any agile approach (KANBAN or Onion Diagram). GIT history must show commits of each team mate.
 
## Multiple levels
- [x] The game must provide at least 2 levels. They should differ regarding difficulty.

## Main Menu
- [x] There must be a main menu. The design is up to you. For instance: A MenuItem called "START" is displayed at the start of the game. In addition there can be "LOAD" or "SAVE". As some of you already implemented.

## Dialog
- [x] The game must contain a dialog. The design is up to you. The dialog and its DialogNodes must be loaded from a JSON. It can be a dialog with an NPC/GameObject or an "Introduction" of the game when starting it.

## LINQ
- [ ] Use LINQ in your implementation. It can be used for handling our GameObjects or Obstacles. You can use the Method or Query based syntax.

## Presentation Video
- [ ] Present your outcomes in a video of 2-5 minutes. Keep it as simple as possible - a simple screencapture is totally fine.
Think of our CodeReviews in class and point out the following topics:
> Project Management: How did you manage your workload?
> Implementation: Walk through the implemented requirements and explain your changes.
> Dialog: show the flowchart of your dialog and explain your design. Point out which type of dialog is chosen and if there are any affects.
> Demonstration of the game: capture the game walkthrough and move through all levels.
> Conclusion: What was challenging? Any impediments?

## OPTIONAL External Config file from Unity
- [ ] If you integrate config files from Unity (JSON) to your C# console app, you gain some extra points.
